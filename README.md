### `üåü This project was created using an Android phone`

### üì± Coding with Android is Amazing!

If you think you need a PC to start coding, think again! With just an Android phone, you can dive into the world of web and app development. Here‚Äôs a showcase of a project created entirely on an Android phone using Acode, Restler, and Termux.

### üîß Tools Used:
- **Acode**: A powerful code editor with features similar to VS Code, such as auto code completion, keyboard shortcuts, and theme customization.
- **Restler**: A REST API client for testing and debugging APIs similar to Postman.
- **Termux**: A terminal emulator for Android that allows you to run Linux commands and scripts.
- **Hacker's Keyboard**: A pc like Keyboard for Android that allows you to use commands like: Ctrl, Alt, F1, F2, (Up, Down, Right, Left Arrow) etc.
